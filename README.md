LD29
====

So the theme for LD29 was beneath the surface. I made a game kind of like terraria, except you control players indirectly by telling them where to go and they dig, drop explosives, run, hop, and make platforms automatically.
There is also a lot less content than a game like terraria, so there is no win condition, but it's kind of neat.

The art/sound/code were all made by me, solo.
